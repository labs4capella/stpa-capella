# Introduction

STPA is a widely recognised [risk analysis method by MIT](https://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/get_file.php?name=STPA_handbook.pdf) whose growing influence is now reaching standards in, e.g., Aeronautics (SAE AIR6913), Defence (IEC 63187) or Automotive (SAE J3187). It originally focuses on Safety but it can be adapted to Cybersecurity or any other concern where the notion of *control* is key. It contributes to consolidating the architecture of solutions by analysing how systems and/or humans collectively behave in order to enforce certain properties. 

This project provides *experimental* tool support for STPA. It enables system architects, designers, domain experts, safety or risk analysis experts to perform STPA analyses in a model-based fashion, either standalone or in combination with [Capella](https://eclipse.dev/capella/)/[Arcadia](https://eclipse.dev/capella/arcadia.html) system architecture modeling. Albeit experimental, it has been successfully used in several real-world projects.

A [user guide](doc/STPA-AddOn-UserGuide.pdf) is available. Familiarity with Capella or other [Sirius](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/)-based modeling tools lowers the learning curve.  
[Installation instructions](https://github.com/eclipse/capella/blob/master/doc/plugins/org.polarsys.capella.ui.doc/html/Installation%20Guide/How%20to%20install%20Capella%20and%20Addons.mediawiki#Configuration-and-Extensibility) are provided as part of the Capella documentation.
